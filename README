Description
-----------
This is PROX, the Packet pROcessing eXecution engine, part of Intel(R)
Data Plane Performance Demonstrators, and formerly known as DPPD-BNG.
PROX is a DPDK-based application implementing Telco use-cases such as
a simplified BRAS/BNG, light-weight AFTR... It also allows configuring
finer grained network functions like QoS, Routing, load-balancing...

Compiling and running this application
--------------------------------------
This application supports DPDK versions 1.7.1 and 2.1.0. Depending on
the DPDK version, the installation procedure is slightly different. The
following commands assume that the following variables have been set:

export PROX_DIR=/path/to/this/application
export RTE_SDK=/path/to/dpdk
export RTE_TARGET=x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc

DPDK 1.7.1 installation
-----------------------
git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
cd dpdk
git checkout v1.7.1
git cherry-pick 98f255ed0a4a73bf785e884dc2069405de840546
git cherry-pick 0d6e2d783d164503e75e57b7358dc3c5c09e0bf1
git cherry-pick 442f3bed6a0964e938c809e8811fa0636ef13f49
git cherry-pick ee19d51ae56dcb685d9a04d9e859873d35565232
git cherry-pick 6573369dd735c43930bfddec34124da05b1584df
git cherry-pick 81ab433fffa4885a76023abd3c8a7e47aee014e3
git cherry-pick 2f95a470b80df115a0a0c9fba4bfbae73f4d66ae
patch -p1 < $PROX_DIR/dpdk-patches/*-DPDK-1.7.1-*.patch
make install T=$RTE_TARGET

Note that patch will succeed, but some hunks will be offset. Since the
patch is meant to apply cleanly to version 1.7.1 without any changes,
some offsetting is expected.

DPDK 2.1.0 installation
-----------------------
git clone http://dpdk.org/git/dpdk
cd dpdk
git checkout v2.1.0
make install T=$RTE_TARGET

PROX compilation
----------------
The Makefile with this application expects RTE_SDK to point to the
root directory of DPDK (e.g. export RTE_SDK=/root/dpdk). If RTE_TARGET
has not been set, x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc will be assumed.

Running PROX
------------
After DPDK has been set up, run make from the directory where you have
extracted this application. A build directory will be created
containing the PROX executable. The usage of the application is shown
below. Note that this application assumes that all required ports have
been bound to the DPDK provided igb_uio driver. Refer to the "Getting
Started Guide - DPDK" document for more details.

Usage: ./build/prox [-f CONFIG_FILE] [-a|-e] [-s|-i] [-w DEF] [-u] [-t]
	-f CONFIG_FILE : configuration file to load, ./prox.cfg by default
	-l LOG_FILE : log file name, ./prox.log by default
	-p : include PID in log file name if default log file is used
	-a : autostart all cores (by default)
	-e : don't autostart
	-s : check configuration file syntax and exit
	-i : check initialization sequence and exit
	-u : Listen on UDS /tmp/prox.sock
	-t : Listen on TCP port 8474
	-w : define variable using syntax varname=value
	     takes precedence over variables defined in CONFIG_FILE

While applications using DPDK typically rely on the core mask and the
number of channels to be specified on the command line, this
application is configured using a .cfg file. The core mask and number
of channels is derived from this config. For example, to run the
application from the source directory execute:

  user@target:~$ ./build/prox -f ./config/nop.cfg

Provided example configurations
-------------------------------
PROX can be configured either as the SUT (System Under Test) or as the
Traffic Generator. Some example configuration files are provided, both
in the config directory to run PROX as a SUT, and in the gen directory
to run it as a Traffic Generator.
A quick description of these example configurations is provided below.
Additional details are provided in the example configuration files.

Basic configurations, mostly used as sanity check:
- config/nop.cfg
- config/nop-rings.cfg
- gen/nop-gen.cfg

Simplified BNG (Border Network Gateway) configurations, using different
number of ports, with and without QoS, running on the host or in a VM:
- config/bng-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-8ports.cfg
- config/bng-qos-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-qos-8ports.cfg
- config/bng-1q-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-ovs-usv-4ports.cfg
- config/bng-no-cpu-topology-4ports.cfg
- gen/bng-4ports-gen.cfg
- gen/bng-8ports-gen.cfg
- gen/bng-ovs-usv-4ports-gen.cfg

Light-weight AFTR configurations:
- config/lw_aftr.cfg
- gen/lw_aftr-gen.cfg
