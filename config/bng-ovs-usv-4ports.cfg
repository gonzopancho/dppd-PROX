; This configuration is provided for virtualized environments running on top of
; a soft-switch. Specifically, ingredients are Open vSwitch (openvswitch.org)
; and Qemu version 1.6.2. Note that since the currently supported version of
; Open vSwitch does not handle all the protocols that are used in the full BNG,
; PROX has to be recompiled to use different packet processing paths as a
; workaround. DPDK version 1.8.0 should be used with this configuration and it
; has to be compiled with COMBINE_LIBS enabled:
;   make install T=$RTE_TARGET CONFIG_RTE_BUILD_COMBINE_LIBS=y CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST=y
; The following commands demonstrate how to set up Open vSwitch:
;   git clone https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs.git
;   cd ovs
;   git checkout 5c62a855c7bb24424cbe7ec48ecf2f128db8b102
;   ./boot.sh && ./configure --with-dpdk=$RTE_SDK/$RTE_TARGET --disable-ssl && make
; This configuration is intended to be used in a VM with 4 virtual ports. This
; means that 4 virtual ports (with type dpdkvhost) and 4 physical ports (with
; type dpdk) will need to be added and connected through open-flow commands in
; Open vSwitch. After Open vSwitch has been set up on the host, PROX needs to be
; recompiled in the VM as follows before running it with this configuration:
;   make BNG_QINQ=n MPLS_ROUTING=n
