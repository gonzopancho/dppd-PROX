-- This script generates a user table containing 65536 users. It is
-- meant to be used in a BNG with 2 CPE facing ports. Each of the CPE
-- facing ports has 32768 users behind it. Each user has a unique
-- svlan/cvlan combination. The only difference between the two sets
-- of users is the svlan id. Note that any arbitrary configuration is
-- possible.
