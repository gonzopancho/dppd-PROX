; This configuration sets up a simplified Border Network Gateway (BNG) on the
; first socket (socket 0). Four load balancers (two physical cores, four logical
; cores) and eight workers (four physical cores, eight logical cores) are set
; up. The number of workers can be changed by uncommenting one of the lines in
; the [variables] section. If this configuration is to be used on a system with
; few cores, the number of workers need to be reduced.
